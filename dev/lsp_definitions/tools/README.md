# Hello

This is the place for things that help me make these lsp definitions  
They may be weird/undocumented/require neovim (i use neovim btw heheheh, totally means i am a better developer than you /s) 

There is one requirement for them: The original form of the definitions before being processed with the tool should not have to be in this repository, and **anyone willing to modify the definitions, and make a PR should not need to use any of these tools**, do not stretch this definition

Oh and also the license of the tool should be CC0 or something like that, and it should be one file, something that you can just leave in your project with no concequences

Ok maybe ignore that last one, bye.
