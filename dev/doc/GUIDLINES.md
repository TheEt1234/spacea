# coding guidelines

**No Swearing** - I (frog), don't actually care if you swear in the code, but contentDB might  
**Do not do whatever modlib does with getfenv/setfenv** - getfenv/setfenv should only be used for sandboxing, using it in any other way can trip up the lsp  
**Attempt to do annotations** - So that multiple people can work on this, pretty important you know
**Use submodules if importing another mod** - Yeah
