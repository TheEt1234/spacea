# spacea_music
The place where all of the sounds/music are/is located, including some notes about them.

# Why not just have the sound effects go in their appropriate mods
- So it's easy to figure out where all the music and sound effects are
- It's easy to also license them here
- It's also a nice place to put all the lmms project files

# Anyway licensing
- All of the sounds prefixed with `tsfx_` (trivial sound effects) are licensed under CC0, by contributing in sounds with that name, in the directory `sounds/` in this mod, you license it as CC0
- This does not apply to sounds prefixed with `sfx_` (if any pop up)

# Guidelines
If possible, music and sound effects should be ""open source"", in my made up definition: have the project source file avaliable (like a thing in your DAW idk)
Due to the fact that they might be large, i think contentDB/git in general, allows you to not export them in contentDB, saving on much needed space
