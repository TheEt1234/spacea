i'll write it down so i *don't forget*:

The goals of this mod should be:
- **to provide in-game documentation**, but not always in the form of a quest
- maybe inform the player of a node's properties (example light_source=x shown through an... idk... upgrade to the inventory?)
- quests

Documentation/quests should be:
- ***NOT*** written in lua, instead in some strict markdown format, my reasoning:
    - Lua has a tousand ways to write a multi line string, some really ugly, some really compact
    - Something like markdown can be a lot more readable if you want to view quests outside of the game
    - it looks better tbh i just like it being written in markdown like sbz quests (minus the ### description stuff, i could avoid that)
