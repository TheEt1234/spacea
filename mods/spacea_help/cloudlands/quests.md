# Charged Cloud Pieces

They are made from combining a [Glowy Cloud Piece](:spacea_mapgen:cloud_piece_glowy) and [Light Cloud Piece](:spacea_mapgen:cloud_piece_light)

Insert a [Glowy Cloud Piece](:spacea_mapgen:cloud_piece_glowy) into a [Light Cloud Piece](:spacea_mapgen:cloud_piece_light), that is placed in world. 

You can also charge up that cloud piece even more, by punching it with a [Heavy Cloud Piece](:spacea_mapgen:cloud_piece_heavy), but they will eventually revert to being less charged.

If a charged cloud piece is charged up too much, it will explode. Strong enough charged cloud pieces will attract [cloud meteorites](#cloud-meteorites). 


## Hint

If that wasn't clear enough:

Obtaining charged cloud pieces:
1) Find a light cloud piece, they are located usually inside of clouds, or at the bottom of clouds
2) Find a glowy cloud piece, they     glow
3) Place your light cloud piece
4) Punch it with a glowy cloud piece (Click with a mouse/trackpad or tap)
5) Enjoy

# Cloud Meteorites

Cloud meteorites, when not being attracted, are very hard to spot, when they crash into a cloud they become light cloud pieces.

If a cloud meteorite is gravitationally attracted, it will become red hot, and when it crashes it transforms into cloudstone, sometimes with Cloudenium.

Your hand isn't strong enough to pull Cloudenium Shards out of Cloudstone, but maybe something else is...

## First Hint

Something explosive....

## Second Hint

The explosion that a fully [Charged Cloud Piece](:spacea_cloud_machines:charged_cloud_piece) makes.

# Cloudenium Shards

By knocking them down from cloudstone, you got a nice digging tool.

They can be also used for picking out other cloudenium shards from crashed cloud meteorites.

You can also grind them into a **powder** by crushing them, with something they can't dig.

## Hint

Punch cloudenium shards into cloudstone, and they will be crushed into a powder.

You can also **hold** right click to turn them into a powder.

# Cloudenium Powder

A powder form of cloudenium. You can place it in the world.

To add more dust to the dust pile you placed, you can right click/place.

When the player stands on it, they get levitated up.
