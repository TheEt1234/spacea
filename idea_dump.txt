- to exit cloudlands, create a portal (no rockets), like minecraft
- on the side of new stuff, would use new stuff's power
- after the player exited the cloudlands, they can still re-visit them with their portal
- a return portal would be made automatically

- some way to transmit charges between charged clouds
- ... that would also be turing-complete like redstone
- would need a charge source
- maybe some sort of charge collector which would collect charge from air, but explode when it gets too much charge
- oh and also some way to make sound here, yes, a note block that accepts charge
- and artificial charged cloud piece which would not explode, and act sort of as both a lamp and a binary charged cloud
    - it would be made with pebbles and cloudenium

What wouldn't fit in cloudlands
- complex machines

- cloudlands should be something like half a hour for a beginner or something like that, can be less, can be more, just somewhere in that range
- cloudlands shouldn't be a chore, they should be new and exciting, and not hard
- there should be a reason to return to cloudlands
- there should be multiple strategies you can take to exit the cloudlands, so that in repeated playthroughs it wouldn't be boring

Schizo ideas:
- NEON CLOUDS OMG I WOULD LOVE IT OMG OMG OMGO MGOM OWOOO WOOO
IMAGINE, an entire land, having like neon aestethics, idk

hmm... what about.. ALTERNATIVE charge types and their interaction with eachother
- maybe neon charge, which would turn things neon, and can easily convert large sections of cloudlands, can only be transfered in very large amounts... with large environmental concequences
    - in a way you could say it makes something <windings>VERY VERY INTERE</windings>- NO.
- cloud charge would have a habit of exploding things, and being the base charge, every charge being a derivative of it, and the easiest charge to transfer

and yeah 2 is enough.

- interactions between them would be interesting, but they would also have their own dedicated tech

also, maybe there could be worlds based on these charges, equally beatable as cloudlands

--------------------
ok so.. i think the THEME of cloudlands is boring
why not just... not have one
why should i disallow myself from adding plants yes

yeah great


so what will be the plan... will cloud charges be like a power unit, or something like redstone that can be created infinitely at will

i think... they should be both maybe
it would probably be crap...

so sure, it could be like redstone

now for the actual power unit...
uhh idk

what could be the introduction to it?...
i dont knowww

Ok, what if there just wasn't a power unit
yeah, cloudlands doesn't need that


Ok, what if there just wasn't a power unit
yeah, cloudlands doesn't need that

but then what

what should be in cloudlands

aaaaaaaaaaa
