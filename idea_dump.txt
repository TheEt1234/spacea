- to exit cloudlands, create a portal (no rockets), like minecraft
- on the side of new stuff, would use new stuff's power
- after the player exited the cloudlands, they can still re-visit them with their portal
- a return portal would be made automatically

- some way to transmit charges between charged clouds
- ... that would also be turing-complete like redstone
- would need a charge source
- maybe some sort of charge collector which would collect charge from air, but explode when it gets too much charge
- oh and also some way to make sound here, yes, a note block that accepts charge
- and artificial charged cloud piece which would not explode, and act sort of as both a lamp and a binary charged cloud
    - it would be made with pebbles and cloudenium

What wouldn't fit in cloudlands
- complex machines

- cloudlands should be something like half a hour for a beginner or something like that, can be less, can be more, just somewhere in that range
- cloudlands shouldn't be a chore, they should be new and exciting, and not hard
- there should be a reason to return to cloudlands
- there should be multiple strategies you can take to exit the cloudlands, so that in repeated playthroughs it wouldn't be boring


hmm... what about.. alternative charge types and their interaction with eachother
- maybe neon charge, which would turn things neon-y? (black inside, bright outline), and can easily convert large sections of cloudlands, can only be transfered in very large amounts... with large environmental concequences
    - in a way you could say it makes something VERY VERY INTERE- NO.
- cloud charge would have a habit of exploding things, and being the base charge, every charge being a derivative of it, and the easiest charge to transfer

- interactions between them would be interesting, but they would also have their own dedicated tech
----------
will cloud charges be like a power unit, or something like redstone that can be created infinitely at will

maybe they should be both maybe
it would probably be crap...

so sure, it could be like redstone

now for the actual power unit...
uhh idk

what could be the introduction to it?...
i dont knowww

Ok, what if there just wasn't a power unit
yeah, cloudlands maybe doesn't need that

but then what

what should be in cloudlands

/shrug
